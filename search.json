    "text": "In this day and age, everyone is always looking to the future. Itâ€™s all about doing the steps now so that goals can be met later. For collegiate athletes, going pro is a goal of many but it is the steps they take in college that can make or break their post-graduation career.\nAdrian Martinez started his collegiate football career at the University of Nebraska before moving to Kansas State in his senior year. At the time, Nebraska was not quite as successful as fans and players had hoped they would be. With that in mind, losing a senior quarterback might not have helped to shift the momentum either.\nTransferring that late in a career can be a big risk, but was one Martinez was willing to take. It helped at least some, seeing as he made it on the New York Jets practice squad this fall, but was Kansas State the right move when wanting to pursue a career in the NFL?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(waffle)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggtext)\n\nm22 &lt;- read_csv(\"data/martinez2022.csv\")\nm21 &lt;- read_csv(\"data/martinez2021.csv\")\nnu &lt;- read_csv(\"data/nebraska2022.csv\")\nkst &lt;- read_csv(\"data/kstate2022.csv\")\n\nfixedm22 &lt;- m22 |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(PassPct))\n\npassing &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_line(data=fixedm22, aes(x=Rk, y=PassPct), color=\"purple\") +\n  geom_line(data=m21, aes(x=Rk, y=PassPct), color = \"red\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(40,90)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:11, labels = paste( 1:11)) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Week\", y = \"Pass Completion Percentage\",\n    caption = \"Source: https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/players/adrian-martinez-2.html |Graph by Krystin Collins\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\nrushing &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_line(data=m22, aes(x=Rk, y=RushAvg), color=\"purple\") +\n  geom_line(data=m21, aes(x=Rk, y=RushAvg), color = \"red\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(-3, 20)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:11, labels = paste( 1:11)) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Week\", y = \"Rushing Average Yards\",\n    title = \"Martinez ran further in the Big 12 and passed better in the Big 10\",\n    subtitle = \"His passing was more consistent at &lt;span style = 'color:red;'&gt;Nebraska&lt;/span&gt; but his run game was more consistent at &lt;span style = 'color:purple;'&gt;Kansas State&lt;/span&gt;\",\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 13.5, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple(size = 9.5),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\nrushing / passing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile at Nebraska, Martinez liked to throw the ball and was pretty good at it. His passing game started a lot more consistent at Nebraska, but his passing average was lower at 62.54%. At Kansas State, his pass completion percentage was averaging 64.26%.\nThose numbers are a bit deceiving since he only played in nine games in the 2022 season after an injury late in November, but he was on the rise before getting hurt. Martinez only had two games in the 2022 season under 60% in pass completion compared to four in 2021.\nHe was also running well as a Wildcat compared to his time as a Cornhusker. Martinez averaged 19 yards against Texas Christian and 14.3 yards against Texas Tech in 2022.\n\n\nCode\ncombined &lt;- read_csv(\"data/m2121.csv\")\n\nbar22 &lt;- combined |&gt;\n  filter(\n    School == \"Kansas State\"\n  )\n\nbar21 &lt;- combined |&gt;\n  filter(\n    School == \"Nebraska\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_bar(\n    data = combined, aes(x = reorder(Opponent, PassYds), weight = PassYds), fill=\"#512888\") +\n  geom_bar(\n    data = bar21, aes(x = reorder(Opponent, PassYds), weight = PassYds), fill=\"#d00000\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Martinez's arm was always in the air at Nebraska\", \n    subtitle = \"Nebraska had a passing offense in 2022, Kansas State did not\",\n    x = \"Opponent\", \n    y = \"Passing Yards\",\n    caption = \"Source: https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/| Graph by Krystin Collins\"\n  ) +  \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNebraska liked to throw the ball on offense. Martinez threw for 351 yards against Wisconsin in 2021 and threw over 200 yards in every other game that season. In 2022, he only had three out of the 10 games he was on the field where he threw over 200 yards.\nBut passing is not the only way to move on the field offensively.\nWhen it comes to rushing yards, Kansas State appeared to be the right spot for Martinez to show off his footwork. He typically rushed for more yards per game but had a few similarities between seasons as well.\nAt both schools, he had two games where he rushed over 100 yards and one game each where he went negative.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() +\n  geom_bar(\n    data = combined, aes(x = reorder(Opponent, RushYds), weight = RushYds), fill=\"#512888\") +\n  geom_bar(\n    data = bar21, aes(x = reorder(Opponent, RushYds), weight = RushYds), fill=\"#d00000\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Opponent\", \n    y = \"Rushing Yards\",\n    title = \"Martinez's hit the ground running at Kansas State\", \n    subtitle = \"Kansas State liked to run the ball on offense in 2022, Nebraska not so much\",\n    caption = \"Source: https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/| Graph by Krystin Collins\"\n  ) +  \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall, Kansas State was the better team. The Wildcats ended the 2021 season at 7-2 while Nebraska ended at 5-4 without ever seeing a bowl game. In 2022, Nebraska once again did not see a bowl game, ending the season at 4-8, while Kansas State improved and went 10-4.\nKansas State had moved the ball more on offense with 445 yards that season and stopped their opponents more on defense, only allowing 375 yards. Nebraska, on the other hand, had almost reverse stats for yardage with 344 offensive yards and 414 yards allowed while on defense.\n\n\nCode\nnu &lt;- read_csv(\"data/nebraska2022.csv\")\nkst &lt;- read_csv(\"data/kstate2022.csv\")\n\nnutotalyards &lt;- nu |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    totalyds = PassYds + RushYds)\n\nksttotalyards &lt;- kst |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    totalyds = PassYds + RushYds)\n  \nnutotal &lt;- c(\"Defense\" = 207, \"Offense\" = 172, 29)\nksttotal &lt;- c(\"Defense\" = 186, \"Offense\" = 222)\n\niron(\n  waffle(\n  ksttotal, \n  rows = 10, \n  title = \"\", \n  colors = c(\"black\", \"purple\")\n) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Kansas State was better than Nebraska in 2022\",\n    subtitle = \"The goal is more offensive yards and less defensive yards\"\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10)),\n  waffle(\n  nutotal, \n  rows = 10, \n  xlab = \"1 square = 2 yards\", \n  colors = c(\"black\", \"red\", \"white\")\n) +\n  labs(\n    caption = \"Source: https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/| Graph by Krystin Collins\"\n  )\n) +\n  theme_minimal() \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNULL\n\n\nGetting injured is always a risk for athletes and leaves unanswered questions about end-of-season performance. Martinez was playing well, and the Wildcats were winning, but would his NFL career have looked different had he been able to finish out the season?\nThat answer will remain unknown, but moving to Kansas State put Martinez on a winning offense and a winning team to end his college football career."
