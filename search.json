    "section": "",
    "text": "Within the standard 60-minute hockey game, there is bound to be a penalty or two from either team. When it comes to playoff time, those penalties are worth even more with the Stanley Cup on the line. The only good that comes from penalties is a trip to the penalty box with an opportunity for a power play for the opposing team.\nPower plays can give an advantage to a team for two or five minutes, but that small amount of time can make a big difference in games.\nBut how much did power plays play into the outcome of the 2024 playoff games?\nIn reality, not as much as you would think. While power plays give teams what one would assume to be an easier time to score, not every team is able to take advantage of that.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(waffle)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nplayoffs &lt;- read.csv(\"data/nhl_playoffs.csv\")\nregular &lt;- read.csv(\"data/nhl_regular.csv\")\npergame &lt;- read.csv(\"data/playoffspergame.csv\")\n\nmutatedgoals &lt;- playoffs |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    RegularGoals = GF - PP.GF\n  )\n\ntotalgoals &lt;- mutatedgoals |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    totaledgoals = RegularGoals + PP.GF\n  )\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data = mutatedgoals,\n    aes(y = reorder(Team, GF), x = PP.GF, xend = RegularGoals),\n    size = 2,\n    colour = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"#C8102E\",\n    colour_xend = \"#FF4C00\")+\n  labs(\n    title = \"Power plays aren't crucial to winning games\", \n    subtitle = \"&lt;span style = 'color:#C8102E;'&gt;Power play goals&lt;/span&gt; helped in the 2024 playoffs, but there were plenty of &lt;span style = 'color:#FF4C00;'&gt;goals scored in regular play&lt;/span&gt;\",\n    x = \"Goals\", \n    y = \"2024 Playoff Teams\",\n    caption = \"Source: NHL | Graph by Krystin Collins\"\n  ) +  \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_markdown(size = 10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPower plays are not always as beneficial as one would think. Some teams do better without all players, due to a sense of urgency and fear of becoming vulnerable due to a hole in their defense and offense.\nA lot of goals are scored in power plays, but even more are scored in regular play. It ratio is not a close as you would think. Looking at the graph, power plays accounted for roughly 20% of goals in playoff games.\nIt could be argued that the playoffs have the best of the best teams who don’t have as many penalties. So, maybe regular season play was different.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(waffle)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nplayoffs &lt;- read.csv(\"data/nhl_playoffs.csv\")\nregular &lt;- read.csv(\"data/nhl_regular.csv\")\npergame &lt;- read.csv(\"data/playoffspergame.csv\")\n\nmutatedgoals23 &lt;- regular |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    RegularGoals = GF - PP.GF\n  )\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data = mutatedgoals23,\n    aes(y = reorder(Team, GF), x = PP.GF, xend = RegularGoals),\n    size = 2,\n    colour = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"#C8102E\",\n    colour_xend = \"#FF4C00\")+\n  labs(\n    title = \"Most goals are scored outside of power plays\", \n    subtitle = \"&lt;span style = 'color:#FF4C00;'&gt;Regular goals&lt;/span&gt; accounted for most goals scored in the 2024 regular season, &lt;span style = 'color:#C8102E;'&gt;power play goals&lt;/span&gt; didn't hurt though\",\n    x = \"Goals\", \n    y = \"Teams\",\n    caption = \"Source: NHL | Graph by Krystin Collins\"\n  ) +  \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_markdown(size = 9.5),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe regular season wasn’t much different though. There was still a substantial difference between the number of goals in and out of power plays.\nThe 2024 championship teams, the Edmonton Oilers and Florida Panthers, weren’t making the most out of their power plays. Teams such as the Colorado Avalanche and Dallas Stars, who were also in the playoffs, had more power play goals and goals in regular play throughout the regular season.\n???\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(waffle)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nplayoffs &lt;- read.csv(\"data/nhl_playoffs.csv\")\nregular &lt;- read.csv(\"data/nhl_regular.csv\")\npergame &lt;- read.csv(\"data/playoffspergame.csv\")\npenalties &lt;- read.csv(\"data/nhl_penalties.csv\")\nindividualpenalties &lt;- read.csv(\"data/individualgamepenalties.csv\")\n\nroundtwo &lt;- individualpenalties |&gt;\n  filter(\n    Team %in% c(\"Carolina Hurricanes\", \"New York Rangers\", \"Boston Bruins\", \"Florida Panthers\", \"Dallas Stars\", \"Colorado Avalanche\", \"Vancouver Canucks\", \"Edmonton Oilers\")\n  )\n\nroundtwo |&gt; summarise(mean(Pen.Drawn, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n\n  mean(Pen.Drawn, na.rm = TRUE)\n1                      3.954545\n\n\nCode\nclass(roundtwo$Game.Date)\n\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\nCode\nroundtwo$Game.Date &lt;- as.Date(roundtwo$Game.Date)\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_hline(\n    yintercept = 3.95,\n    color = \"#C8102E\"\n  ) +\n  geom_line(\n    data = roundtwo,\n    aes(x = Game.Date, y = Pen.Drawn, group = Team)\n    ) +\n  scale_x_date(\n    breaks = seq.Date(from = as.Date(\"2024-04-20\"), to = as.Date(\"2024-06-24\"), by = \"1 month\"),  \n    date_labels = \"%b\",  \n    limits = c(as.Date(\"2024-04-20\"), as.Date(\"2024-06-24\"))  \n  ) +\n  facet_wrap(~Team) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"The 2024 playoff penalties were all across the board\", \n    subtitle = \"Championship teams were not above having a lot of penalties during games\",\n    x = \"Playoff Dates\", \n    y = \"Penalties Drawn\",\n    caption = \"Source: NHL | Graph by Krystin Collins\"\n  ) +  \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_markdown(size = 10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe graph below looks at the number of power plays averaged in a game, compared to the number of playoff games with, and the size of the dot representing the number of goals while on a power play.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(waffle)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nplayoffs &lt;- read.csv(\"data/nhl_playoffs.csv\")\nregular &lt;- read.csv(\"data/nhl_regular.csv\")\npergame &lt;- read.csv(\"data/playoffspergame.csv\")\n\noilers &lt;- playoffs |&gt; filter(Team == \"Edmonton Oilers\")\npanthers &lt;- playoffs |&gt; filter(Team == \"Florida Panthers\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data = playoffs, \n      aes(\n        x = PP.Opp.GP, \n        y = W, \n        size = PP.GF),\n      alpha = 0.5\n      ) +\n  scale_size(range = c(3, 8), name = \"Points\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data =oilers, \n      aes(\n        x = PP.Opp.GP, \n        y = W, \n        size = PP.GF),\n      color = \"#FF4C00\"\n      ) +\n  geom_point(data = panthers, \n      aes(\n        x = PP.Opp.GP, \n        y = W, \n        size = PP.GF),\n      color = \"#C8102E\"\n      ) + \n  geom_text_repel(\n    data = playoffs, \n    aes(\n      x = PP.Opp.GP, \n      y = W, \n      label=Team,\n      size = 1\n    )\n  )  +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Average Power Plays Per Game\",\n    y = \"Games Won\",\n    title = \"Championship teams made good use of power plays\",\n    subtitle = \"During the 2024 playoffs, Edmonton and Florida used their power plays very effectively\",\n    caption = \"Source: NHL | By Krystin Collins\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    legend.position = \"none\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDid teams make good use of power plays when they had them?

For collegiate athletes, going pro is a goal of many but it is the steps they take in college that can make or break their post-graduation career.\nAdrian Martinez started his collegiate football career at the University of Nebraska before moving to Kansas State in his senior year. At the time, Nebraska was not quite as successful as fans and players had hoped they would be. With that in mind, losing a senior quarterback might not have helped to shift the momentum either.\nTransferring that late in a career can be a big risk, but was one Martinez was willing to take.

At Kansas State, his pass completion percentage was averaging 64.26%.\nThose numbers are a bit deceiving since he only played in nine games in the 2022 season after an injury late in November, but he was on the rise before getting hurt. Martinez only had two games in the 2022 season under 60% in pass completion compared to four in 2021.\nHe was also running well as a Wildcat compared to his time as a Cornhusker.

Martinez threw for 351 yards against Wisconsin in 2021 and threw over 200 yards in every other game that season. In 2022, he only had three out of the 10 games he was on the field where he threw over 200 yards.\nBut passing is not the only way to move on the field offensively.\nWhen it comes to rushing yards, Kansas State appeared to be the right spot for Martinez to show off his footwork. He typically rushed for more yards per game but had a few similarities between seasons as well.\nAt both schools, he had two games where he rushed over 100 yards and one game each where he went negative.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() +\n  geom_bar(\n    data = combined, aes(x = reorder(Opponent, RushYds), weight = RushYds), fill=\"#512888\") +\n  geom_bar(\n    data = bar21, aes(x = reorder(Opponent, RushYds), weight = RushYds), fill=\"#d00000\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Opponent\", \n    y = \"Rushing Yards\",\n    title = \"Martinez's hit the ground running at Kansas State\", \n    subtitle = \"&lt;span style = 'color:#512888;'&gt;Kansas State&lt;/span&gt; liked to run the ball on offense in 2022, &lt;span style = 'color:#d00000;'&gt;Nebraska&lt;/span&gt; not so much\",\n    caption = \"Source: https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/| Graph by Krystin Collins\"\n  ) +  \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple(size = 10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall, Kansas State was the better team. The Wildcats ended the 2021 season at 7-2 while Nebraska ended at 5-4 without ever seeing a bowl game. In 2022, Nebraska once again did not see a bowl game, ending the season at 4-8, while Kansas State improved and went 10-4.\nKansas State had moved the ball more on offense with 445 yards that season and stopped their opponents more on defense, only allowing 375 yards. Nebraska, on the other hand, had almost reverse stats for yardage with 344 offensive yards and 414 yards allowed while on defense.\n\n\nCode\nnu &lt;- read_csv(\"data/nebraska2022.csv\")\nkst &lt;- read_csv(\"data/kstate2022.csv\")\n\nnutotalyards &lt;- nu |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    totalyds = PassYds + RushYds)\n\nksttotalyards &lt;- kst |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    totalyds = PassYds + RushYds)\n  \nnutotal &lt;- c(\"Defense\" = 207, \"Offense\" = 172, 29)\nksttotal &lt;- c(\"Defense\" = 186, \"Offense\" = 222)\n\niron(\n  waffle(\n  ksttotal, \n  rows = 10, \n  title = \"\", \n  colors = c(\"black\", \"purple\")\n) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Kansas State was better than Nebraska in 2022\",\n    subtitle = \"The goal is more offensive yards and less defensive yards\"\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"),\n  waffle(\n  nutotal, \n  rows = 10, \n  xlab = \"1 square = 2 yards\", \n  colors = c(\"black\", \"#d00000\", \"white\")\n) +\n  labs(\n    caption = \"Source: https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/| Graph by Krystin Collins\"\n  )\n) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting injured is always a risk for athletes and leaves unanswered questions about end-of-season performance. Martinez was playing well, and the Wildcats were winning, but would his NFL career have looked different had he been able to finish out the season?\nThat answer will remain unknown, but moving to Kansas State put Martinez on a winning offense and a winning team to end his college football career."
