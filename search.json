    "text": "Adrian Martinez started out his collegiate football career at the University of Nebraska before making the move to Kansas State in his senior year. Nebraska had not has been quite as successful in recent years as fans would hope they would be. With that in mind, losing a quarterback during his final year of college football doesn’t help with progress.\nTransferring that late in a career can be a big risk, especially for a quarterback looking to play beyond their college days. Martinez must have saw better potential in the Wildcats to leave the 2022 season. It must have made a difference since he made it on the New York Jets practice squad this fall, but was Kansas State the difference making in his NFL career?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(waffle)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nm22 &lt;- read_csv(\"data/martinez2022.csv\")\nm21 &lt;- read_csv(\"data/martinez2021.csv\")\nnu &lt;- read_csv(\"data/nebraska2022.csv\")\nkst &lt;- read_csv(\"data/kstate2022.csv\")\n\nfixedm22 &lt;- m22 |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(PassPct))\n\npassing &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_line(data=fixedm22, aes(x=Rk, y=PassPct), color=\"purple\") +\n  geom_line(data=m21, aes(x=Rk, y=PassPct), color = \"red\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(40,90)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:11, labels = paste( 1:11)) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Week\", y = \"Pass Completion Percentage\",\n    caption = \"Source: https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/players/adrian-martinez-2.html |Graph by Krystin Collins\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\nrushing &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_line(data=m22, aes(x=Rk, y=RushAvg), color=\"purple\") +\n  geom_line(data=m21, aes(x=Rk, y=RushAvg), color = \"red\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(-3, 20)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:11, labels = paste( 1:11)) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Week\", y = \"Rushing Average Yards\",\n    title = \"Martinez ran further in the Big 12 and passed better in the Big 10\",\n    subtitle = \"His passing was more consistent at Nebraska but his run game was more consistent at Kansas State\",\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\nrushing / passing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTaking a look at his time at Nebraska, Martinez liked to throw the ball and he was pretty good at it. His passing game started out a lot more consistent at Nebraska but ended at a better spot before his injury in 2022. His average pass percentage was 62.54% at Nebraska, compared to 64.26% at Kansas State.\nThose numbers are a bit deceiving since he only played 9 games in the 2022 season after an injury late in November but he was on the rise before getting hurt. Martinez only had two games in the 2022 season under 60% in pass completion compared to 4 in 2021.\n\n\nCode\ncombined &lt;- read_csv(\"data/m2121.csv\")\n\nbar22 &lt;- combined |&gt;\n  filter(\n    School == \"Kansas State\"\n  )\n\nbar21 &lt;- combined |&gt;\n  filter(\n    School == \"Nebraska\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_bar(\n    data = combined, aes(x = reorder(Opponent, PassYds), weight = PassYds), fill=\"#512888\") +\n  geom_bar(\n    data = bar21, aes(x = reorder(Opponent, PassYds), weight = PassYds), fill=\"#d00000\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Martinez's arm was always in the air at Nebraska\", \n    subtitle = \"Nebraska had a passing offense\",\n    x = \"Opponent\", \n    y = \"Passing Yards\",\n    caption = \"Source: https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/| Graph by Krystin Collins\"\n  ) +  \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNebraska liked to throw the ball on offensive. Martinez threw for 351 yards against Wisconsin in 2021 and threw over 200 yards in every other game that season. In 2022, he only had three out of the 10 games he played that he threw over 200 yards.\nBut passing is not the only way to move on the field offensively.\nWhen it comes to rushing yards, Kansas State was the right spot for Martinez to show off his footwork.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() +\n  geom_bar(\n    data = combined, aes(x = reorder(Opponent, RushYds), weight = RushYds), fill=\"#512888\") +\n  geom_bar(\n    data = bar21, aes(x = reorder(Opponent, RushYds), weight = RushYds), fill=\"#d00000\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Opponent\", \n    y = \"Rushing Yards\",\n    title = \"Martinez's hit the ground running at Kansas State\", \n    subtitle = \"Kansas State liked to run the ball on offense\",\n    caption = \"Source: https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/| Graph by Krystin Collins\"\n  ) +  \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow let’s look at who was the better team overall…\n\n\nCode\nnu &lt;- read_csv(\"data/nebraska2022.csv\")\nkst &lt;- read_csv(\"data/kstate2022.csv\")\n\nnutotalyards &lt;- nu |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    totalyds = PassYds + RushYds)\n\nksttotalyards &lt;- kst |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    totalyds = PassYds + RushYds)\n  \nnutotal &lt;- c(\"Defense\" = 207, \"Offense\" = 172, 29)\nksttotal &lt;- c(\"Defense\" = 186, \"Offense\" = 222)\n\niron(\n  waffle(\n  ksttotal, \n  rows = 10, \n  title = \"\", \n  colors = c(\"black\", \"purple\")\n) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Kansas State was the better team in 2022\",\n    subtitle = \"The goal is more offensive yards and less defensive yards\"\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10)),\n  waffle(\n  nutotal, \n  rows = 10, \n  xlab = \"1 square = 2 yards\", \n  colors = c(\"black\", \"red\", \"white\")\n) +\n  labs(\n    caption = \"Source: https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/| Graph by Krystin Collins\"\n  )\n) +\n  theme_minimal() \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNULL"
